Harry was also marked by what Lord Voldemort once deemed a \"weakness for heroics\"\n\u2014 he would go to great lengths and take great risks in order to help others, particularly his loved ones.\nNotably, this was taken advantage of by Voldemort in 1996, when he lured Harry to the Department of Mysteries\nby making him believe that his godfather was in danger. Harry was also very strong-willed and unafraid to\nstand up for himself. The fact that he was capable of repelling the Imperius Curse suggests that he had an unusually\nstrong sense of himself and his morals."

Because of her efficiency and compassion, Hermione often had\ntime to do hobby work on the side, such as preparing a defence for Buckbeak to save him from execution and \ncreating S.P.E.W., an organisation promoting the freedom of house-elves. Such acts demonstrated her social \nconscience and tenacity."

    "text": "## BIO\nThrough his own nature, Lord Voldemort was the ultimate epitome of pure evil, a man who constantly craved horror,\ncontention and bloodshed, and spread nothing but darkness and suffering anywhere he went, considered by many to be\n'the most evil wizard in hundreds and hundreds of years'. His malevolence far exceeded that of any common evildoer \nand Dumbledore stated that he 'went beyond normal evil' in the extent of his crimes. Hagrid claimed that while all \nDark wizards 'go bad', Voldemort went 'worse than worse'. Indeed, Voldemort speedily developed into a power-obsessed \nmegalomaniac of the worst kind and the worst of any known Dark wizard, being considered by all to be far more evil than \neven Gellert Grindelwald. He was unable and unwilling to express remorse or empathy for the countless crimes he had \ncommitted. This was a stark contrast to Grindelwald, a well-meaning extremist who proved to display genuine remorse \nfor his crimes and even before his fall, pity for those abused for their magic and even if only a little, care for his\nfollowers, all which Voldemort completely lacked. These misanthropic traits were seen in his childhood, from stealing \nto disturbing incidences with other orphans. Dumbledore stated that the young Riddle had a certain disregard for rules. \nIn his adult life, he performed the darkest forms of magic and valued no living thing other than himself. First and \nforemost, he loved causing a trail of never-ending death and destruction to justify his own nihilism. Hence, he was a \nprolific killer, as seen by his killing so many that he created an army of Inferi."
