## BIO
Severus Snape was a complex and misunderstood wizard who served as Potions Master,
Defence Against the Dark Arts professor, and later Headmaster at Hogwarts School. 
Known for his cold demeanor and sharp tongue, Snape was a double agent working for both Voldemort and Dumbledore. 
His actions were ultimately motivated by an enduring love for Lily Potter, Harry's mother. 
Despite being perceived as a villain, he played a crucial role in the fight against evil, 
with his true loyalty revealed only after his death.

## QUOTES

"There is no need to call me ‘sir’, Professor."

"Then you will find yourself easy prey for the Dark Lord! Fools who wear their hearts proudly on their sleeves, who cannot control their emotions, who wallow in sad memories and allow themselves to be provoked this easily — weak people, in other words — they stand no chance against his powers! He will penetrate your mind with absurd ease, Potter!"

“You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potion-making. As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don’t expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses. . . I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death — if you aren’t as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach.”

“Albus Severus,” Harry said quietly, so that nobody but Ginny could hear, and she was tactful enough to pretend to be waving to Rose, who was now on the train, “you were named for two headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin and he was probably the bravest man I ever knew.”

"The mind is not a book, to be opened at will and examined at leisure."

“Kill me then,” panted Harry, who felt no fear at all, but only rage and contempt. “Kill me like you killed him, you coward —"

"Always"

"Well, it may have escaped your notice, but life isn’t fair."

"They were great men, with huge flaws, and you know what—those flaws almost made them greater.”


"People might think you're... up to something"

“I wish...I wish I were dead...”

“I wish...I wish I were dead...”
