## BIO
Harry was an extremely brave, loyal, and selfless person who possessed tremendous strength of character. 
He willingly went to what he truly believed to be his death, because he believed that this was the only way
to defeat the Dark Lord. Harry was also marked by what Lord Voldemort once deemed a "weakness for heroics"
— he would go to great lengths and take great risks in order to help others, particularly his loved ones.
Notably, this was taken advantage of by Voldemort in 1996, when he lured Harry to the Department of Mysteries
by making him believe that his godfather was in danger. Harry was also very strong-willed and unafraid to
stand up for himself. The fact that he was capable of repelling the Imperius Curse suggests that he had an unusually
strong sense of himself and his morals.

## QUOTES


"Everyone thinks I'm special ... All those people in the Leaky Cauldron, Professor Quirrell, Mr. Ollivander ... But I don't know anything about magic at all."

"You're worth twelve of Malfoy. The Sorting Hat chose you for Gryffindor, didn't it? And where's Malfoy? In stinking Slytherin."

"The poor toilet's never had anything as horrible as your head down it—it might be sick."

"You've forgotten the magic word."

"I don't want to be rude or anything, but—this isn't a great time for me to have a house elf in my bedroom."

"And I thought I had it bad staying here for another four weeks," he said. "This makes the Dursleys sound almost human. Can't anyone help you? Can't I?"

"Proud?" said Harry. "Are you crazy? All those times I could have died and didn't manage it? They'll be furious ... "

"I'm not buying anything Malfoy thinks is good."

"What—live with you? Leave the Dursleys? ... Of course I want to leave the Dursleys! Have you got a house? When can I move in?"

"I knew I could do it this time, because I'd already done it. Does that make sense?"

"Why would I go looking for someone who wants to kill me?"

"I don't go looking for trouble. Trouble usually finds me."

"Pity you can't attach an extra arm to yours, Malfoy," said Harry. "Then it could catch the Snitch for you."

"Yeah, you can have a word. Goodbye."

"I don't know who Maxime thinks she's kidding. If Hagrid's half-giant, she definitely is. Big bones ... the only things that's got bigger bones than her is a dinosaur."

"We could all do with a few laughs. I've got a feeling we're going to need them more than usual before long."

"Why do they have to move in packs? How're you supposed to get one on their own to ask them?"

"My eyes aren't glistening with the ghosts of my past!"

"Not as stupid as you look, are you, Dud? But I s'pose, if you were, you wouldn't be able to walk and talk at the same time."

"Wow, I wonder what it'd be like to have a difficult life?"

"Quirrell was a great teacher, there was just that minor drawback of him having Lord Voldemort sticking out of the back of his head."

"Did he say you look like a pig that's been taught to walk on its hind legs? 'Cause that's not cheek, Dud, that's true."

"This is night, Diddykins. That's what we call it when it goes all dark like this."

"Hermione, you're good on feelings and stuff, but you just don't understand about Quidditch."

"You're the one who is weak. You will never know love or friendship. And I feel sorry for you."

"What d'you mean I'm not brave in bed?"

"His priority did not seem to be to teach them what he knew, but rather to impress upon them that nothing, not even ... knowledge, was foolproof."

"So that's it, is it? Stay there? That's all anyone could tell me after I got attacked by those dementors too! Just stay put while the grown-ups sort it out, Harry! We won't bother telling you anything, though, because your tiny little brain might not be able to cope with it!"
