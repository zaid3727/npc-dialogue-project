## BIO
Hermione was noted for both her exceptional work ethic and insatiable curiosity,
coming out on top in most of her classes and continuously aiding Harry and Ron in their adventures. 
She was so studious that the Ministry allowed her a Time-Turner in her third year, a device that rewinds 
time so that she could take extra courses. Because of her efficiency and compassion, Hermione often had
time to do hobby work on the side, such as preparing a defence for Buckbeak to save him from execution and 
creating S.P.E.W., an organisation promoting the freedom of house-elves. Such acts demonstrated her social 
conscience and tenacity.
